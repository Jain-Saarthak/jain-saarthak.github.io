## Portfolio

I am currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science from Arizona State University and will graduate in May 2023. I wish to pursue a career in Software Engineering and am actively looking for software engineering roles.

I am in good academic standing (CGPA: 4.00/4.00) and have 2+ years of professional work experience as a Software Engineer with the Walmart group, where I designed, developed, tested, and deployed 20+ A/B-tested products using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, React Native, Node.js, Jest, Python, etc. 

In my free time, I pursue my passion for learning new technology and have built projects leveraging Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Augmented Reality, Embedded Sensors, Blockchain, etc., in the past, which has helped me become a well-rounded software engineer.
